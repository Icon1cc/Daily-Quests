# Stacks and Queues

This section covers stack and queue data structure problems.

## Topics
- Stack operations
- Queue operations
- Monotonic stack
- Design problems
- Expression evaluation

## Problems
- [x] Valid Parentheses - Checking balanced brackets

## Recommended Order
1. Valid Parentheses

## Tips
- Stacks follow LIFO (Last In First Out)
- Queues follow FIFO (First In First Out)
- Monotonic stacks are useful for "next greater/smaller element" problems
- Consider using deque for efficient operations
