# Trees and Graphs

This section covers binary trees, BST, and graph problems.

## Topics
- Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Binary Search Trees
- Graph algorithms

## Problems
- [x] Binary Tree Inorder Traversal - Traverse tree in order

## Recommended Order
1. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Tips
- Understand the difference between DFS and BFS
- Recursion is natural for trees, but iterative solutions save space
- For graphs, consider using adjacency lists or matrices
- Remember to handle cyclic graphs with visited tracking
