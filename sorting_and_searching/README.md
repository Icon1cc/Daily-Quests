# Sorting and Searching

This section covers various sorting and searching algorithms.

## Topics
- Binary search and variants
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Counting sort
- Search in rotated arrays

## Problems
- [x] Binary Search - Classic binary search implementation

## Recommended Order
1. Binary Search

## Tips
- Binary search requires sorted data
- Watch out for integer overflow in mid calculation: use `left + (right - left) // 2`
- Consider edge cases (empty array, single element, target at boundaries)
- Time complexity should be O(log n) for binary search
