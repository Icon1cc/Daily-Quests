# Dynamic Programming

This section covers dynamic programming problems.

## Topics
- Memoization (Top-down)
- Tabulation (Bottom-up)
- State transitions
- Optimization problems
- String DP

## Problems
- [x] Climbing Stairs - Classic Fibonacci-style DP problem

## Recommended Order
1. Climbing Stairs

## Tips
- Start with recursive solution, then add memoization
- Convert memoization to tabulation for better performance
- Identify overlapping subproblems
- Look for opportunities to optimize space complexity
- Draw state transition diagrams
