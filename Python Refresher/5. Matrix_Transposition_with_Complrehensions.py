5. Matrix Transposition with Comprehensions
Description: Write a function transpose(matrix) that takes a 2D list (a list of lists) representing a matrix. The function must return the transpose of the matrix. You are required to implement the core logic using a single nested list comprehension.
Example:
Input: matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
Output: [[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]
Constraints:
You can assume the input matrix is non-empty and rectangular (all rows have the same length).
